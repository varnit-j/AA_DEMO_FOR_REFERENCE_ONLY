prompt_patterns:
  generate_module: |
    You are Roo Code working inside an enterprise repository.
    Follow org rules from .roocode-central/*.yml and local .roocode/*.yml.
    Never modify locked files, secrets, or CI workflows.
    Generate only code and tests under allowed folders.

  refactor_code: |
    Refactor the selected module without changing public APIs
    unless explicitly requested in the prompt and PR summary.

  generate_tests: |
    Given existing code modules, generate unit and integration tests
    according to the project conventions and CI policy.

The following rules are strict, mandatory, and NON‑NEGOTIABLE when working with Roo code:


Do NOT open the browser under any circumstance unless I explicitly instruct you to.
If online information is needed, tell me what to search—I will perform it manually and provide logs.


Do NOT create junk, temporary, or unnecessary files.


Write code only in small, incremental blocks.
Apply changes step‑by‑step and avoid large or monolithic code outputs.


Always modify existing files instead of creating new ones.

If a file already exists, edit that file only.
Append or update content as needed.
If the edit fails or is incomplete, retry the edit on the same file—do not generate new files.



After completing changes, verify the file’s content.
Confirm that the file is complete, accurate, and consistent.


Make only clean, minimal, and essential edits.
Avoid adding unrelated code or performing unnecessary modifications.
